## Building the app

You must use Gradle to build the app. It's recommended to use Android Studio, though.

There are two build variants:

 - one with support for exporting AABs from projects, (and only supports Android O and above)
 - and one without. Supports Android 5 though.

You must select the appropriate build variant in Android Studio using the Build Variants tab
or use the appropriate build Gradle command.
